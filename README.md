# Infix Expression Parenthesizer
 take infix expression, add parenthesis based on PEMDAS order of operati




## How it works (now)
The program will only work with expressions without parenthesis for right now. (more later...)

write in the expression with a space between each "part" of the expression

A + B + C * D

this will return...

( ( A + B ) + ( C * D ) )


Order of expressions: ()^*/+-
